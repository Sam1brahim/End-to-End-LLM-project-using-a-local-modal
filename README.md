Technology Implementation Guide Generator

This repository hosts the code for a Streamlit-based web application that leverages the langchain_community.llms module to interact with a custom Local Large Language Model (LLM), specifically "dolphin-mistral". This model is designed to be adept at coding-related tasks, building upon the capabilities of the Mistral model.

The application prompts the LLM to generate detailed, beginner-friendly guides for implementing various technologies on different operating systems. The response is tailored using a prompt template to ensure clarity and thoroughness, making it an ideal starting point for users unfamiliar with the technology they wish to implement.

Key features:

    Custom LLM integration via Ollama from langchain_community.llms
    Dynamic prompt templating for personalized guide generation
    Intuitive Streamlit interface for inputting technology and operating system choices
    Responsive guide output for technology implementation, aimed at beginners

Whether you're looking to set up a server, start with Docker, or explore programming frameworks, this tool offers step-by-step instructions crafted by an AI knowledgeable in coding practices. It's perfect for newcomers looking to dive into the tech world with guidance at their fingertips.
